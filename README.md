## dice_roll.py  
**Roll the dice and guess the dice number!**  

The Dice Roll game is a simple Python program where the user guesses the outcome of a dice roll. The program generates two random dice rolls, sums them up, and checks if the user's guess matches the total.  

### Features  
- Generates two random dice rolls.  
- Allows the user to guess the total value of the dice rolls.  
- Validates the user's input.  
- Displays the results with a slight delay for an engaging experience.  
- Declares the user as a winner if their guess matches the total or encourages them to try again if they lose.  

### Use Case  
The Dice Roll game is a fun and interactive way to:  
- Practice basic Python programming skills, especially with random number generation and user input handling.  
- Understand control flow with conditions and loops in Python.  
- Introduce beginners to concepts like probability and randomness in a simple, engaging manner.  
- Provide a quick, entertaining program for casual play or educational demonstrations.  

### How It Works  
1. The user is prompted to enter a guess.  
2. The program rolls two dice with 6 sides (default).  
3. It calculates the maximum possible value of the dice rolls and checks if the guess is valid.  
4. The dice rolls are revealed one at a time, followed by the total.  
5. If the user's guess matches the total, they win. Otherwise, they lose.  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 2.x (Uses `raw_input` and print statements with `%` formatting specific to Python 2).  

### Installation  
1. Clone or download the repository containing this program.  
2. Ensure you have Python 2.x installed on your system.  

### Usage  
1. Run the program in a Python 2.x interpreter:  
   ```bash
   python dice_roll.py
   ```  
2. Follow the prompts:  
   - Enter your guess when prompted.  
   - Wait for the results as the program rolls the dice and displays the outcome.  

### Example Output  
```bash
Guess a number: 7  
Maximum possible value is 12.  
Rolling...  
The first roll is 3  
The second roll is 4  
7  
Result...  
You have won!  
```  

### Customization  
- You can customize the number of sides on the dice by modifying the `roll_dice` function. For example:  
   ```python
   first_roll, second_roll, max_val = roll_dice(10)
   ```  
   This will use a 10-sided die instead of the default 6-sided die.

## ic_checker.py  
**ID Checker for validity of NRIC/FIN (Singapore ID)**  

The IC Checker module validates Singapore NRIC (National Registration Identity Card) and FIN (Foreign Identification Number) using an official checksum algorithm.  

### Features  
- Validates NRIC and FIN numbers using prefix and checksum rules.  
- Supports both NRIC (e.g., `S1234567D`) and FIN (e.g., `G1234567Q`) formats.  
- Provides clear error messages for invalid or improperly formatted IDs.  

### Use Case  
Ideal for scenarios where quick and reliable validation of Singapore IDs is required, such as in personal projects or applications requiring user ID verification.  

### Example Usage  
```python
from ic_checker import validate_id

id_number = "S1234567D"
if validate_id(id_number):
    print("Valid NRIC/FIN!")
else:
    print("Invalid NRIC/FIN.")
```

## largest_product.py  
**Largest Product Series**  

This module calculates the largest product of `n` consecutive digits in a numeric series.  

### Features  
- Calculates the product of any specified number of consecutive elements (`n`).  
- Handles both numeric strings and arrays of integers.  
- Validates input to ensure the series contains only digits or numbers.  

### Example Usage  
```python
from largest_product_series import calculate_largest_product

series = "73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934"
n = 6
result = calculate_largest_product(series, n)
print(f"The largest product of {n} consecutive digits is: {result}")
```

## rock_paper_scissors.py  
**A Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  

The classic game against a computer opponent.  

### Features  
- User selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
- Randomly generates the computer's choice.  
- Determines the winner based on the rules of the game.  

### Usage  
1. Run the program in a Python 2.x interpreter:  
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```  
2. Follow the prompts:  
   - Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).  
   - Wait for the result.

## Server Timestamp and Nmap HTML Viewer  

**A PHP script to display server time and Nmap scan results.**  

### Features  
- Displays the server's current timestamp.  
- Embeds the content of `nmap.html`.  

### Prerequisites  
1. A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx).  
2. `nmap.html` file in the same directory as the PHP script.  

### Example PHP Script  
```php
<?php
echo "Server Timestamp: ";
echo date("h:i:sa");
echo "<pre>";
include("nmap.html");
echo "</pre>";
?>
```
